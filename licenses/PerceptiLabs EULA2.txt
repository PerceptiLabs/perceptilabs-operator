PerceptiLabs AB (“PerceptiLabs”) is a Swedish corporation, located in Stockholm, Sweden. It is the author and owner of all rights in and to the computer program called PL Modelling Platform, and all versions and updates thereof. PL Modelling Platform is a drag-and-drop program that allows users to build complex AI/ML models simply, without the need to code, combining different operations in a pure dataflow driven manner." 
This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") formalizes the relationship between PerceptiLabs, as Licensor, and You, the Licensee. It is a contract. If you have accessed the Trial License version or full version on behalf of your employer or university or otherwise as an agent or contractor on behalf of another individual or entity, You represent and warrant that You have the authority to bind that employer or other entity to these terms and conditions and Your agreement to these terms and conditions will be treated as the agreement of Your employer or other individual or entity. PerceptiLabs is relying upon Your representation where the Software Product assists or supports the business or academic goals of your employer or other entity. Accordingly, references to “You” or “Your” means both You and Your employer or other entity.
For purposes of this EULA, the term “Software Product” includes both PL Modelling Platform and any of its associated documentation, applications or services, libraries as well as any updates, add-on components, web services and/or supplements that PerceptiLabs may provide to You or make available in the future. To the extent that such items are not accompanied by a separate license agreement, the terms and conditions of this EULA shall apply.
This EULA is a legal agreement between You, a single user, and PerceptiLabs, which sets forth the terms and conditions of Your use of the Software Product under the license being granted to You by PerceptiLabs. You understand and agree that by clicking the “I agree” button—or by otherwise installing, copying, adapting, distributing, using or accessing the Software Product—you will be bound by these terms and conditions.
